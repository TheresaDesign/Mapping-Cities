        <p>Sticky positioning is the unapologetic love child of position: relative and position: fixed (in which said love child grows up to do bigger and better things while still retaining the lessons of its parents). An element with a position: sticky declaration remains static in the document until a certain threshold is reached, and then it becomes fixed once scrolled to that threshold. A threshold is defined by any directional declaration such as: top: 0;, which becomes fixed once the element reaches the top edge of its parent.

            A sticky element is always relatively positioned to its parent (much like position: absolute;). This means that these elements will stick and unstick only within the bounds of its parent element, not the viewport (making our job easier); it also means that the thresholds are marked by the edges of the parent. The great thing about this constraint is that you can control the overlap (or lack thereof) of multiple stuck elements.</p>
